# IoT Traffic Modelling and Byte Stream Generation

This is a repo which uses existing traffic data gathered from IoT devices over an OpenWRT router and fits the byte size of packets sent to a statistical distribution. Random variables are generated from this distribution to determine the byte size of packets send over a TCP connection to emulate IoT device traffic.
